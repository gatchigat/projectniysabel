        <p><b>Whatever your politics and whatever you may think of the names on the ballot,
the people who will lead in these positions will be selected. It’s up to you to decide
whether you will sit this one out, or participate in the democratic process.</b></p>

<h1>5 Things To Do Before You Vote!</h1>

<ol>
<li><b> Be sure that you are properly registered to vote</b></li>
<p>You may believe that you are already registered. But you should check to be certain
that you haven’t mistakenly been dropped from the voter rolls and to be sure that your
current address is listed.</p>

<li><b>Get a sample ballot based on where you live</b></li>
<p>A sample ballot will help you make sense of which races will be on your ballot this
year and which won’t. You may see tons of political signs near your home supporting a
certain candidate, but that’s no guarantee that you actually will see them on your ballot.
By getting a sample ballot and reading over it in advance, you can plan your votes ahead
and not risk becoming confused over so many contests and names when you go to the polls.</p>

<li><b>Study the candidates and amendments to make voting decisions in advance</b></li>
<p>With a sample ballot in hand, take some time before you vote to learn what you can
about the candidates. The Internet can be a great tool for this. Check out their campaign
websites to see what they claim to stand for, which group of voters they are trying to
appeal to and what they might have said about their opponents. Talk about the candidates
with family members and friends you respect to see what they think.
<br><br>
Read your local newspaper to see whether candidates are making news for things they
have done or views they have expressed. For any local ballot initiatives, local news
sources are among your best options for learning about what is it stake.
<br><br>
Many newspapers also publish endorsements or other opinion pieces that may
present useful arguments for how to vote. Think about whether you usually
agree or disagree with the viewpoints expressed in your newspaper before deciding
on how endorsements should affect your vote. Some people do exactly what their
favorite newspaper recommends. Some voters do exactly the opposite of the endorsements
in a local newspaper that they love to hate. Many other voters consider the quality of
the arguments each opinion article makes and use these ideas in making their own decisions.</p>

<li><b>Decide on your voting method and find your polling location</b></li>
<p>Those voting on Election Day can use the lookup tool described above to identify the right
place to vote. You can also call or visit your county elections office and ask them to
look up the right polling place for you.
<br><br>
Voting early and voting on Election Day each have their pros and cons.<br><br>
If you vote early, you won’t risk having an emergency or unexpected conflict on Election Day.
Voting lines on Election Day are often unusually long, though sometimes early voting lines
are longer than might be convenient. For many people, their polling place for Election Day
is near their home, but voting at an early voting site near their place of work might be more convenient.<br><br>
However, if you vote early, you do run the risk of locking in your vote ahead of
news that might change your decision – a candidate might say something outrageous,
be arrested or even die before Election Day. If you vote on Election Day, you will
have the maximum amount of time to study the candidates and amendments and think
carefully about the best choices. The answer on which way to vote will be different
for each person, but the key is to plan ahead.</p>

<li><b>Figure out how you will get to the polls, when and with whom</b></li>
<p>This is an important step, whether you are voting on Election Day or going early.<br><br>
If you will be driving yourself, decide whether you will go by yourself, with other
family member or with friends. If you don’t drive, find someone to give you a ride to the polls.<br><br>
Think about your work schedule on the day you plan to vote and be sure that you will
have made the proper arrangement with your workplace, picking up your children,
or whatever other responsibilities you might have so that everything will go smoothly.<br><br>
Some voters bring underage children with them to the polls so that they can observe and learn
about the democratic process. Other voters don’t want that sort of distraction.
Think about this sort of thing ahead of time.<br><br>
Some voters may need assistance in casting a ballot.
Having help may be especially important if you have visual 
impairment, dyslexia or some other disability that could make 
it difficult to read and mark the ballot. If you believe you will
want assistance in voting, plan ahead to ask someone you know and
trust to accompany you and provide this help.</p>
