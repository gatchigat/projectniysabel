        <p> <b>The purpose of this website is to broaden the knowledge of the voters about the Upcoming Election. All citizens of the Philippines,
            eighteen years of age or over, and residents of the Philippines for one year and for at least six months in the city or municipality wherein
            he/she proposes to vote immediately preceding the election are qualified to vote.</b>

        <h1>Electoral Politics in the Philippines</h1>

        <p>Elections are integral to democratic governance. Through the mechanism of
          elections, politicians are held accountable for their actions, and are compelled
          to introduce policies that are reflective of and responsive to public opinion.
          Ideally, elections serve as a 'major source of political recruitment, a means of
          making government, and of transferring government power, a guarantee of
          representation, and a major determinant of government policy' (Heywood, 2000:
          200). These do not, however, prevent the distortion of the will of the electorate
          in a 'flawed democracy'.

          In the Philippines, the plurality system has been enshrined in the 1935, 1973,
          and 1987 constitutions. Under the 1987 constitution, all elective officials –
          president, vice-president, senators, members of the House of Representatives,
          local chief executives and local legislators – are chosen by a direct vote of the
          people through a 'first-past-the-post system' (Agra, 1997b: 1). The Philippine
          electoral system has generally been consistent throughout history.

          The Philippine experience with electoral politics is instructive in the process of
          democratic development in the Asia-Pacific region. Nearly a century since
          American colonial authorities introduced electoral and party politics, the quality
          of democratic representation as an outcome of elections has always been held
          in doubt. Clientelism, nepotism, fraud and violence, among others, have
          reinforced the elitist nature of Philippine electoral politics. This was exacerbated
          during the period of Marcos' authoritarian rule as democratic elections were
          briefly replaced by 'demonstration elections' held under duress. The ouster of
          the Marcos dictatorship in February 1986 has ushered in a period of
          redemocratization. Nonetheless, the election and subsequent removal of
          President Joseph Estrada in January 2001 remains a constant reminder of the
          continuing 'defects' of Philippine democracy.

        <h2>Voter Registration for 2022 Philippine Elections Ends</h2>

        <p>The Comelec says it expects to have 65 million Filipinos eligible to cast
          their ballots for the 2022 polls once voter registration ends.
        </p>

        <p>Saturday, October 30, marked the last day of voter registration in the Philippines for the 2022 elections,
          a high-stakes vote that will determine President Rodrigo Duterte's successor.
          Days before the deadline, various local offices and satellite registration sites of the Commission on Elections
          (Comelec) dealt with an influx of voter applicants, who camped out as early as midnight to make it to the cutoff.
          Because of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, registration sites could only accommodate a few hundred applicants daily.
          Online registration for first-time applicants in the Philippines is not allowed by law.
