        <h2>Who Can Register as a Voter in the Philippines?</h2>
<p><b>You’re qualified to register as a voter in the Philippines if you meet all these eligibility requirements:</b></p>
<ol>
<dl>
<dd>
<li>Filipino citizen who has never registered with COMELEC</li>
<li>At least 18 years old on or before the upcoming election on May 9, 2022</li>
<li>At least 15 but not older than 30 years old for Sangguniang Kabataan (SK) Elections</li>
<li>Living in the Philippines for at least one year and in the city or municipality
where you intend to vote for at least six months before an election</li>
</dd>
</dl>
</ol>
<p><b>Make sure to accomplish these three things before heading to the COMELEC office for registration.</b></p>

<ol>
<li><b>Prepare the COMELEC Registration Requirements</b></li>
<p><b>What are the requirements for voter’s registration, you might ask? For first-time voters, 
COMELEC registration requirements include at least one of the following valid IDs and a photocopy:</b></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Driver’s license</li>
<li>IBP ID</li>
<li>NBI clearance</li>
<li>Passport</li>
<li>Postal ID</li>
<li>PRC ID</li>
<li>PWD ID</li>

</ul>

</dd>

</dl>
<p><b>Additional requirements for COMELEC registration:</b> Original and photocopy of birth

<li><b>Download and Accomplish the Voter’s Registration Form</b></li>
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/v36rmkn/Screen-Shot-2020-09-09-at-3-47-10-PM-e1599637674195.webp" alt="Screen-Shot-2020-09-09-at-3-47-10-PM-e1599637674195" border="0">

<p>The COMELEC recommends downloading the application forms from its website,
 printing them, and filling them out manually at home before your registration.<br><br>

However, don’t put your signature and thumb marks in advance. The COMELEC requires 
doing this only in front of the election officer during voter’s registration.</p>

<p><b>COMELEC Registration Form Guidelines</b></p>

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Click the CEF-1 link to download the voter’s registration form. Print it on a long bond paper
(8.5″ x 13″). A4 or legal size paper is not allowed.</li>
<li>Annex B (Supplementary Data Form) is for PWDs, senior citizens with disabilities, 
indigenous people, applicants who can’t read or write, or those who will assist such voters. Download this form only if it’s applicable to you.</li>
<li>Completing the Coronavirus Self Declaration Form is also a requirement for COMELEC 
registration. It’s best to download and fill it out before you register.</li>
<li>If you can’t access the voter’s registration forms when the COMELEC website is 
down, you can download them from the website of COMELEC Spokesperson James Jimenez.</li>

</ul>

</dd>
</dl>
<li><b>Book an Appointment with Your Local COMELEC Office</b></li>
<p>As part of its efforts to contain the COVID-19 spread, the COMELEC is processing only a limited 
number of transactions per day. To make sure your trip to the COMELEC won’t turn to waste, contact
 your local COMELEC office to set an appointment for your voter’s registration.<br><br>

If there’s no appointment system in the COMELEC office where you’re supposed to register, 
this means you can do a walk-in application. Come as early as possible so that you 
can be accommodated within the registration hours.</p>
