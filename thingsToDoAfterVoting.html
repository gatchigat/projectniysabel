        <h1>10 Things To Do After The Election</h1>

<ol>
<li><b>Engage with your elected officials online and offline</b></li>
<p>Whether your candidate won or lost the election, the results are final.
Now it’s time to hold these folks accountable!</p>

<li><b>Stay in the loop on city and county council meetings</b></li>
<p>Research when your city council or county commission has their meetings.
Try to attend and consider making a public comment on an issue when you feel
inclined. If you can’t attend, make an effort to read through the
meeting minutes posted on your municipality website.</p>

<li><b>Prepare to get involved in the upcoming state session</b></li>
<p>Begin by researching how your state government operates and passes bills
and appropriations. Look at who the other representatives are in the state
as well, because it takes a group effort to get anything done.</p>

<li><b>Volunteer for an organization or cause</b></li>
<p>Volunteer your time and experience helping an organization that is accomplishing
a mission aligned with your values. You can volunteer for events, help fundraise,
advocate online and offline, or join a board of directors.</p>

<li><b>Apply for a city, county, or state advisory board</b></li>
<p>Put your valuable experiences and perspectives to use! Find a municipal or state advisory board that fits your background and interests.</p>

<li><b>Get involved in your local party or a civic engagement group</b></li>
<p>If you’re a registered voter with a party affiliation, don’t just join your party,
but engage your party. Join a committee within your local party, or at least support those that do. </p>

<li><b>Research upcoming leadership and campaign training programs</b></li>
<p>There is a need for new blood in the political world — not just candidates,
but also those working behind the scenes. There are organizations of every 
background and affiliation providing these trainings, but you need to find the
ones most able to bring out your potential. </p>

<li><b>Put your opinion out there</b></li>
<p>There are podcasts, blogs, and videos being recorded and posted
every day. Look into some of the publications and media already out there
to see what tickles your fancy. If you find a lack of coverage on an issue
like referred to in #2, then start your own! Make sure you know your facts
because in todays influencer market, more and more people are getting
their information from people that they follow.</p>

<li><b>Help register voters and vote-by-mail sign ups</b></li>
<p>ust because the election is over does not mean that voter registration is over.
In fact, you should take advantage of the newly-felt FOMO (fear of missing out) that I’m sure non voters are experiencing.</p>

<li><b>Prepare for next elections!</b></li>
<p>Reach out early to ask questions about their responses
to the issues important to you, and hold them accountable
to so. If nothing else, maybe it’s your time to run!</p>
