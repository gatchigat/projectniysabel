        <h1>5 Reason Why You Should Vote!</h1>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> It's so important to understand what you are voting about.
Voting is already underway, so read up, take notes, and be sure to vote early.</p>

<p>This year's election goes beyond who will be president. Your vote is your voice and
issues affecting housing, education, employment and healthcare.</p>

<ol>

<li><b>Elections have consequences.</b></li>
<p>You have the power to decide on the quality of life you want for yourself and
future generations. Voting is your chance to stand up for the issues you care about
like public transportation, raising minimum wage, or funding local schools. This is
your life: take the time to help decide what’s best.</p>

<li><b>Not voting is giving up your voice.</b></li>
<p>Elections are decided by the people who go out and vote. Take some time and learn
about the measures and the candidates. If you don’t vote, someone else will make
the decision for you. Your power is in your vote.</p>

<li><b>It's your money</b></li>
<p>You pay taxes, but do you know how that money is being used? Most people don’t.
Voting is your chance to choose how your tax dollars are spent – such as funding 
for health care and social services.</p>

<li><b>Voting is an opportunity for change.</b></li>
<p>Do you want to make a positive impact? Voting gives you that chance! Support the
candidates and ballot measures that can help your community, state, and even the nation
for the greater good. Make your voice heard in these elections.</p>

<li><b> The community depends on you!</b></li>
<p>Our communities are made up of friends, loved ones, neighbors, and children. Some may
not know how important voting is, while others don’t have the privilege. Make the
decision to vote for yourself and those around you.</p>

</ol>
<p>Make sure your voice is heard - <b>VOTE!</b></p>
